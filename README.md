Black Jack Card Counting
For online cassinos i read that it's not 100 acurrate(some shit like small amount of decks , and   deck penetration is low) , but you can see dealer didnt blackjacked and i win(when the counting is on player side) , so if u  ganna use  it's your choice<br>
## Todo
Maybe hook brave.exe for automatic drawing the count value on screen?
